# TO-DO

- Working auto-gain processor, probably some distinct class whose gains are supplied by each individual processor

- Advanced options including stereo/mono switch, stereo/MS linking for compressor

- Cabs, both the processing and UI features
  
  - much to be done here. Multiple mic options, movable mics? Or shall we stick to just a few different cabs, keep it basic?

  - so far have added a guitar cab and a bass cab, not really sure how good they sound yet

- Getting different defaults for different modes? Would need to make them separate States if so.

- SIMD implementation
